## Introduction

This R Markdown document demonstrates my abilities to use models for data analysis using a data set collected on crickets.

```{r load data, include = FALSE}
data(crickets, package = "modeldata")
names(crickets)
```

## What is that sound?

In this report, we examine what factors predict a cricket's chirp rate.

```{r summary, echo= FALSE}
summary(crickets)
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = rate)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 8) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of the chirp rates of crickets") +
  xlab('Chirp rate (per min.)')
```
